cellDancer - Estimating Cell-dependent RNA Velocity
===========================================================================================

**cellDancer** is a modularized, parallelized, and scalable tool based on a deep learning framework for the RNA velocity analysis of scRNA-seq proposed by `Li et al. (Nature Biotechnology, 2023) <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01728-5>`_. The gene phase portraits of `Sulf2` in the pancreatic endocrinogenesis data and `Gnao1` in the mouse hippocampus development data below show the training process of the DNN (deep neural network).

cellDancer's key applications
========================================================
* Enable accurate inference of dynamic cell state transitions in heterogeneous cell populations.
* Estimate cell-specific transcription, splicing and degradation rates for each gene and reveal RNA turnover strategies.
* Improves downstream analysis such as vector field predictions.
